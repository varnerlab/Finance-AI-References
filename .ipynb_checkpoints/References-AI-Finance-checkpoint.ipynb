    "* [Sean Shun Cao, Wei Jiang, Lijun (Gillian) Lei, Qing (Clara) Zhou. (2024) Applied AI for finance and accounting: Alternative data and opportunities, Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 84: 102307. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pacfin.2024.102307](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X24000581). Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed the finance industry by altering the way data and information are generated, processed, and incorporated into decision-making processes. Data and information have emerged as a new class of assets, facilitating efficient contracting and risk-sharing among corporate stakeholders. Researchers have also increasingly embraced machine learning and AI analytics tools, which enable them to exploit empirical evidence to an extent that far surpasses traditional methodologies. In this review article, prepared for a special issue on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Finance in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, we aim to provide a summary of the evolving landscape of AI applications in finance and accounting research and project future avenues of exploration. Given the burgeoning mass of literature in this field, it would be unproductive to attempt an exhaustive catalogue of these studies. Instead, our goal is to offer a structured framework for categorizing current research and guiding future studies. We stress the importance of blending financial domain expertise with state-of-the-art data analytics skills. This fusion is essential for researchers and professionals to harness the opportunities offered by data and analytical tools to better comprehend and influence our financial system.\n",

    "* [Artificial Intelligence and its Impact on Financial Markets and Financial Stability, International Monetary Fund, 2024](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/09/06/sp090624-artificial-intelligence-and-its-impact-on-financial-markets-and-financial-stability). IMF Financial Counsellor Tobias Adrian argues that AI, especially generative AI, is rapidly advancing and will significantly impact financial markets by enhancing efficiency, processing unstructured data, and potentially transforming trading practices. While AI offers productivity gains, cost savings, improved regulatory compliance, and deeper liquidity for quantitative investors, it also poses risks to financial stability by potentially increasing market volatility and interconnectedness, necessitating reevaluation of margin requirements, circuit breakers, and central counterparty resilience. The IMF stresses the need for updated supervisory frameworks, better monitoring of nonbank entities and AI service-provider interdependencies, and investment in sup-tech to counter emerging cyber threats. Lastly, the IMF is integrating AI considerations into its upcoming Global Financial Stability Report and capacity-building initiatives to assist member countries with AI-related challenges and opportunities in finance.\n",

    "* [Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services, United States Treasury, 2024](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Financial-Services.pdf). The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s whitepaper examines how financial firms utilize AI—from traditional machine learning to generative models—to improve underwriting, trading, risk management, compliance, customer service, and operational efficiency. Based on 103 stakeholder submissions, the report emphasizes AI’s capabilities to enhance decision-making, broaden financial inclusion through alternative data, and streamline back-office tasks while highlighting the need for substantial data, computing power, and third-party expertise. It cautions that AI can magnify existing risks, including bias, “black-box” opacity, data privacy issues, and “hallucinations,” potentially centralizing market power among large model providers and increasing systemic vulnerabilities. To address these issues, contributors recommend clearer data standards, improved privacy safeguards (including re-evaluation of GLBA’s opt-out framework), enhanced third-party risk management, and uniform consumer-protection oversight for banks and nonbanks. The report advocates for aligning AI definitions, updating regulatory frameworks, promoting interagency and public-private collaboration, and prioritizing explainability and fairness in model development to balance innovation with necessary safeguards for responsible AI deployment in financial services.\n",

    "* [Buchanan, Bonnie. (2019). Artificial intelligence in finance. Alan Turing Institute. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2612537](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/artificial-intelligence-finance). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming financial services by using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to process large amounts of data, enhancing credit risk assessment, algorithmic trading, fraud detection, robo-advisory, and customer service through chatbots. Advances in computing power, data availability, and specialized hardware have accelerated the shift from rule-based systems to ML models that can model nonlinear relationships and reveal hidden patterns in financial data. Although the U.S. initially led AI investment, China has become a major player, increasing competition among global fintech hubs. In banking and capital markets, AI tools automate anomaly detection and real-time scoring, while insurance, real estate, and corporate finance benefit from automation and predictive analytics. The report highlights the difference between ML’s predictive focus and traditional econometric methods’ emphasis on statistical inference, noting trade-offs in interpretability. It also discusses early quantum computing efforts as a potential enabler for tasks like portfolio optimization. Recognizing challenges such as algorithmic bias, “black box” risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and systemic stability concerns, the report urges updated regulations, robust validation techniques, and international collaboration. Ultimately, it stresses the need for balanced innovation and safeguards to harness AI’s potential while managing risks in the financial sector."
