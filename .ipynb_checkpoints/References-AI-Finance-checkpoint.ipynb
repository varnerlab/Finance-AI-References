    "* [Roy P, Ghose B, Singh PK, Tyagi PK, Vasudevan A. Artificial Intelligence and Finance: A bibliometric review on the Trends, Influences, and Research Directions. F1000Res. 2025 Jan 23;14:122. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.160959.1. PMID: 39911727; PMCID: PMC11795023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11795023/). This bibliometric study analyzes over 600 peer-reviewed articles to map the evolution of AI applications in finance. Using the Theory-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) framework, it identifies major research themes: risk management, market efficiency, financial innovation, and ethical AI. Key theoretical foundations include the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Behavioral Finance, and Agency Theory. The study examines practical applications in algorithmic trading, fraud detection, credit risk assessment, insurance, and ESG investing. It reviews empirical, experimental, simulation, and mixed-methods research while highlighting gaps in interdisciplinary approaches and ethical considerations. This article evaluates the academic landscape and practical challenges in AI-driven finance.\n",

    "* [Vuković, D.B., Dekpo-Adza, S. & Matović, S. AI integration in financial services: a systematic review of trends and regulatory challenges. Humanit Soc Sci Commun 12, 562 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-04850-8](https://rdcu.be/epCUO). The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial services represents a developmental shift in the industry, presenting unprecedented opportunities and challenges. This scientometric review examines the evolution of AI in finance from 1989 to 2024, analyzing its pivotal applications in credit scoring, fraud detection, digital insurance, robo-advisory services, and financial inclusion. The analysis reveals significant trends, particularly the growing adoption of machine learning, natural language processing, and blockchain technologies in reshaping financial operations and decision-making processes. The review addresses critical regulatory and ethical challenges, emphasizing the imperative for explainable AI (XAI) and robust governance frameworks to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI-driven systems. Despite rapid advancements, persistent gaps remain, the most notable of which is the lack of standardized frameworks for AI implementation across financial sectors. The findings support the need for a balanced approach that promotes innovation while addressing ethical, regulatory, and societal concerns. This comprehensive synthesis maps the trajectory of AI in finance, identifies key areas for future research, and recommends interdisciplinary collaboration to advance responsible and sustainable AI integration within the financial ecosystem.\n",

    "* [Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services (2025) World Economic Forum Whitepaper](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Financial_Services_2025.pdf). This white paper offers an overview of AI's transformative impact on financial services, based on industry roundtables and research. It describes how AI automates and enhances work in banking, insurance, capital markets, and payments, with firms projected to invest $97 billion by 2027. The report highlights use cases like customer service automation, fraud detection, and risk management, discussing the shift from efficiency to revenue growth strategies. It also addresses challenges like data transparency, privacy, cybersecurity, and regulatory gaps, emphasizing the need for industry collaboration for responsible AI deployment.\n",

    "* [Sean Shun Cao, Wei Jiang, Lijun (Gillian) Lei, Qing (Clara) Zhou. (2024) Applied AI for finance and accounting: Alternative data and opportunities, Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 84: 102307. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pacfin.2024.102307](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X24000581). Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed the finance industry by altering the way data and information are generated, processed, and incorporated into decision-making processes. Data and information have emerged as a new class of assets, facilitating efficient contracting and risk-sharing among corporate stakeholders. Researchers have also increasingly embraced machine learning and AI analytics tools, which enable them to exploit empirical evidence to an extent that far surpasses traditional methodologies. In this review article, prepared for a special issue on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Finance in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, we aim to provide a summary of the evolving landscape of AI applications in finance and accounting research and project future avenues of exploration. Given the burgeoning mass of literature in this field, it would be unproductive to attempt an exhaustive catalogue of these studies. Instead, our goal is to offer a structured framework for categorizing current research and guiding future studies. We stress the importance of blending financial domain expertise with state-of-the-art data analytics skills. This fusion is essential for researchers and professionals to harness the opportunities offered by data and analytical tools to better comprehend and influence our financial system.\n",

    "* [Artificial Intelligence and its Impact on Financial Markets and Financial Stability, International Monetary Fund, 2024](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/09/06/sp090624-artificial-intelligence-and-its-impact-on-financial-markets-and-financial-stability). IMF Financial Counsellor Tobias Adrian argues that AI, especially generative AI, is rapidly advancing and will significantly impact financial markets by enhancing efficiency, processing unstructured data, and potentially transforming trading practices. While AI offers productivity gains, cost savings, improved regulatory compliance, and deeper liquidity for quantitative investors, it also poses risks to financial stability by potentially increasing market volatility and interconnectedness, necessitating reevaluation of margin requirements, circuit breakers, and central counterparty resilience. The IMF stresses the need for updated supervisory frameworks, better monitoring of nonbank entities and AI service-provider interdependencies, and investment in sup-tech to counter emerging cyber threats. Lastly, the IMF is integrating AI considerations into its upcoming Global Financial Stability Report and capacity-building initiatives to assist member countries with AI-related challenges and opportunities in finance.\n",

    "* [Buchanan, Bonnie. (2019). Artificial intelligence in finance. Alan Turing Institute. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2612537](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/artificial-intelligence-finance). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming financial services by using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to process large amounts of data, enhancing credit risk assessment, algorithmic trading, fraud detection, robo-advisory, and customer service through chatbots. Advances in computing power, data availability, and specialized hardware have accelerated the shift from rule-based systems to ML models that can model nonlinear relationships and reveal hidden patterns in financial data. Although the U.S. initially led AI investment, China has become a major player, increasing competition among global fintech hubs. In banking and capital markets, AI tools automate anomaly detection and real-time scoring, while insurance, real estate, and corporate finance benefit from automation and predictive analytics. The report highlights the difference between ML’s predictive focus and traditional econometric methods’ emphasis on statistical inference, noting trade-offs in interpretability. It also discusses early quantum computing efforts as a potential enabler for tasks like portfolio optimization. Recognizing challenges such as algorithmic bias, “black box” risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and systemic stability concerns, the report urges updated regulations, robust validation techniques, and international collaboration. Ultimately, it stresses the need for balanced innovation and safeguards to harness AI’s potential while managing risks in the financial sector."
